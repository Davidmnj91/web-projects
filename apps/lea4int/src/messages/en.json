    "description": "My name is Lucia Soto, the Founder and Managing Director of LEA 4 International. The inspiration behind establishing this company stems from the profound impact of my experiences abroad, which significantly enriched my life.<br></br>My initial venture into international experiences occurred through the Erasmus program. Throughout my university studies, I seized the opportunity to be an Erasmus student for a year at the Faculty of Law at La Sapienza University in Rome. This transformative experience went beyond merely studying in a different country and acquiring a new language. It illuminated the essence of the Erasmus program fostering connections with people outside one's comfort zone, developing tolerance towards diverse cultures, and embracing new challenges.<br></br>Erasmus marked just the beginning of my international journey. Since then, I've had the privilege of living in various countries and interacting with people from around the world. My professional background, particularly as a project coordinator for Erasmus+ projects, equipped me with the essential tools for the successful implementation of such initiatives.<br></br>The primary objective of my company is to globally promote the significance of education. I aspire to encourage individuals, especially young students, to step out of their comfort zones, explore the world beyond, and create memorable life experiences abroad. Simultaneously, I aim to contribute to the enhancement of education and cross-cultural understanding.",
